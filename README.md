## CARS DATASET
Here, the data of different cars are given with thier specifications.</br >
This data is available as a CSV file. We are going to analyze this dataset using pandas data frame.

The commands that I used in this project :

* import pandas as pd -- To import Pandas library
* pd.read_csv - To import the CSV file in Jupyter notebook
* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5)
* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
* df.isnull( ).sum( ) - It detects the missing values from each column of the dataframe.
* fillna() - To fill the null values of a column with some particular value
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied to a single column only.
* isin() - To show all records including particular elements
